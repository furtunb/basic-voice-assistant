### What This Code Do?


It's doing some basic stuff.
- play - stop - resume stuff on YouTube 
- Taking notes
- Open apps you want to open
- Giving information about what you searching for
- Send message in WhatsApp Desktop (I didn't want to send via WhatsApp Web, but it can be arranged)


### How to use it

#### 1. These libraries must be downloaded:
speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatki, pyjokes, wikipedia, pyautogui, time

#### 2. Compile the code and say what you want to do. (Listening in background feature can be added(optional))


It's that easy to use. There's nothing else to do
